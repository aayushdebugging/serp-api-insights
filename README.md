# Healthcare Staffing Intelligence API

A comprehensive intelligence gathering system for healthcare staffing opportunities, specifically designed for clinical recruitment in modalities like Radiology, MRI, CT, Echo, Cath Lab, and Interventional procedures.

## üéØ Purpose

This API provides **actionable intelligence** for healthcare staffing companies by monitoring:
- **Recent hiring activity** (last 7-14 days) for clinical roles
- **Executive changes** and organizational shifts  
- **Facility expansions** and new service lines
- **Market signals** indicating staffing needs

   PORT=3000
   ```

### Installation & Running
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Server will run at `http://localhost:3000`

## üìä Main Endpoint

### Intelligence Gathering
